## Introduction

Playing with typescript, understanding its use in with NodeJS Express

## Start

- Initialize the folder

```sh
npm init
```

This will ask you a series of questions. For this project we‚Äôll answer the following

    Does your project use TypeScript? : Yes
    Where does your code run? : Node
    What format do you want your config file to be in? : JavaScript
    Finally, you will be prompted to install some additioanl eslint libraries. Choose Yes.

- Configure your package.json

```js
